[js-written-number](https://github.com/yamadapc/js-written-number ) is an npm package for __converting Arabic numbers to their written form__

e.g.  
```writtenNumber(1234)``` will return 'one thousand two hundred and thirty-four'

***

* It's a very basic NLP application
* Only support to English written form
* Maybe we will encounter the need of number -> Chinese in the future
