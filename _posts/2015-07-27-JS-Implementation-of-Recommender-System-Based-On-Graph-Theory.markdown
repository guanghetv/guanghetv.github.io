[This article](https://medium.com/@keithwhor/using-graph-theory-to-build-a-simple-recommendation-engine-in-javascript-ec43394b35a3 ) introduces a way to implement recommendation system on a NodeJS based server using Javascript (ES6). It's really practical since the author paid much attention on the light-weight disign and the robust / flexibility of the system.

It's an awesome example to explore the possibility of building a recommender system for Yangcong Math.
