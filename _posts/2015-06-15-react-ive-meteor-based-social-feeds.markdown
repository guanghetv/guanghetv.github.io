[This site](http://react-ive.meteor.com/ ) applies Facebook-made React and meteor toward a relatively mature social platform.

In the example the site provided, everyone can signup an account and automatically logged in. All the feeds (incl. posts and comments) by all the people can be seen by each other.

Reactive feeling is so cool!
