[clusterize.js](http://nexts.github.io/Clusterize.js/ ) is a plugin to boost large data display in frontend. I was shocked when trying their demo, it loaded and scrolled a table about 500,000 rows easily.

* We've had a fabulous TI sites (miner) and the plugin could make displaying large data details possible and available.
* The speed of the web is very important, no one's willing to wait for even some seconds.
